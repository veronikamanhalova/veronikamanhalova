## 🎓 Bachelor’s Thesis – VR Climbing Simulator

One of my main projects is my **Bachelor’s Thesis**, where I designed and developed a **VR climbing simulator** in Unity using the XR Interaction Toolkit.  
The simulator is set on the **obelisk of the Faculty of Architecture at CTU** and features:

- 🧗 Realistic climbing mechanics with hand-based interactions  
- 🏗️ Procedural generation of climbing paths with variation in difficulty 
- 🎮 VR-optimized user interface and menus  
- 📊 User testing with questionnaires as part of the evaluation part of my thesis
